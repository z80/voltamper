Demos in this directory:

- async

  This demo illustrates the use of Asynchronous Method Invocation
  (AMI).

- MFC

  Shows how to use Ice-E in conjunction with the Microsoft Foundation
  Classes.

- bidir

  This demo shows how to use bi-directional connections for callbacks.
  This is typically used when the server cannot open a connection to
  the client to send callbacks, for example, because firewalls block
  incoming connections to the client.

- callback

  A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a
  proxy to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the server
  call back into an object provided by the client as part of that
  invocation.

- chat

  MFC and command-line clients that work with the Glacier2 chat demo
  found in the Ice distribution.

- hello

  This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
  well as how to invoke oneway operations and how to use batched 
  invocations.

- latency

  A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
  Ice-E.

- minimal

  The simplest Ice-E demo, equivalent to "Hello, World".

- nested

  A demo to illustrate how nested callbacks work, and how the size of
  the thread pool affects the maximum nesting depth.

- throughput

  This demo allows you to send sequences of various types between
  client and server and measure the maximum bandwidth that can be
  achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

- value

  This demo shows how to use classes, class factories, and the
  difference between local and remote invocations of class operations.

- workqueue

  This application illustrates the use of the threading and
  synchronization primitives provided by the Ice-E library. It uses
  Ice-E to implement a simple producer/consumer queueing application.
