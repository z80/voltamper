NOTE: This client requires an Ice-E client library that includes AMI
support.

The client-side portion of the MFC hello demo. Note that this demo can
be used with the MFC server, or any of the other hello servers (for
example, the one contained in demo/IceE/hello). 

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ cd ../server
$ server

Then start the client:

$ client

To test timeouts, enable the "Timeout" check box to set a timeout on
the client proxy and the "Delay" check box to force the server to
delay its response long enough to trigger the timeout in the client.
You will notice that the server prints two "Hello World!" messages.
These occur because the Slice operation sayHello is marked as
idempotent, which allows the Ice run time to retry the operation in
the case of a timeout failure. See the Ice manual for more information
about retry behavior.
