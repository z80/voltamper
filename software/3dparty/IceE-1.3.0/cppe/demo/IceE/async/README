This demo illustrates the use of Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI).

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ cd server
$ server

In a second window, start the client:

$ cd client
$ client 

The demo invocation can either have a short response time or require a
significant amount of time to complete. For the long running request,
the client uses AMI and the server blocks a thread from the thread
pool to process the request. While a long request is processing, short 
requests are still able to be processed and more long requests can be
queued for processing, up to the maximum number of threads allowed in
the server's thread pool.
