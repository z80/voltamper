A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various
types between client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth
that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ cd server
$ server

In a separate window, start the client:

$ cd client
$ client
